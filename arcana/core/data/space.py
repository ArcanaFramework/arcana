class DataSpace(Enum):
    """
    Base class for all "data space" enums. DataSpace enums specify
    the relationships between rows of a dataset.

    For example in imaging studies, scannings sessions are typically organised
    by analysis group (e.g. test & control), membership within the group (i.e
    matched subjects) and time-points (for longitudinal studies). We can
    visualise the rows arranged in a 3-D grid along the `group`, `member`, and
    `timepoint` dimensions. Note that datasets that only contain one group or
    time-point can still be represented in the same space, and just be of
    depth=1 along those dimensions.

    All dimensions should be included as members of a DataSpace subclass
    enum with orthogonal binary vector values, e.g.

        member = 0b001
        group = 0b010
        timepoint = 0b100

    In this space, an imaging session row is uniquely defined by its member,
    group and timepoint ID. The most commonly present dimension should be given
    the least frequent bit (e.g. imaging datasets will not always have
    different groups or time-points but will always have different members
    (equivalent to subjects when there is one group).

    In addition to the data items stored in the data rows for each session,
    some items only vary along a particular dimension of the grid. The
    "row_frequency" of these rows can be specified using the "basis" members
    (i.e. member, group, timepoint) in contrast to the `session` row_frequency,
    which is the combination of all three

        session = 0b111

    Additionally, some data is stored in aggregated rows that across a plane
    of the grid. These frequencies should also be added to the enum (all
    combinations of the basis frequencies must be included) and given intuitive
    names if possible, e.g.

        subject = 0b011 - uniquely identified subject within in the dataset.
        batch = 0b110 - separate group+timepoint combinations
        matchedpoint = 0b101 - matched members and time-points aggregated across groups

    Finally, for items that are singular across the whole dataset there should
    also be a dataset-wide member with value=0:

        dataset = 0b000
