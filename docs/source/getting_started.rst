Getting started
===============


Installation
------------

Docker
~~~~~~

To automatically generate Docker pipelines for XNAT's container service and run
the unit-test suite Docker, Arcana needs Docker to be installed. Please see
the Docker docs for how to do this, `<https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>`_.


Third-party dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the main strengths of Pydra is the ability to link 3rd party tools into
coherent workflows. Obviously these software also need to be installed separately
unless they run within Docker containers (recommended). See  


Python package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Arcana can be installed from the `Python Package Index <http://pypi.org>`_ using *Pip3*::

    $ pip3 install arcana


Basic usage
-----------

Arcana can be used either as a Python library or a command-line interface (CLI)
toolkit.
