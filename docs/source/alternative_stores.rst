Alternative storage systems
===========================

Alternative storage systems can be implemented by writing a new sub-class of
:class:`.DataStore`. The developers are interested in adding support for new systems,
so if you would like to use Arcana with a different storage system please
create an issue for it in the `GitHub Issue Tracker <https://github.com/Australian-Imaging-Service/arcana/issues>`__.
